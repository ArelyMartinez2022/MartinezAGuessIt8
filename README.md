GUESS IT #8 

THIS PROGRAM WILL ASK THE USER IF THEY WANT TO PICK EASY, 
MEDIUM, OR HARD MODE FOR A GUESSING GAME. (THAT WILL REQUIRE 
DATA VAILDATION OTHERWISE THEY WILL BE ASKED OVER AND OVER 
AGAIN UNTIL THEY INPUT A VAILD RESPONSE.) ONCE THE USER ENTERS 
THE MODE THEY WOULD LIKE THEY WOULD HAVE TO GUESS FROM A RANGE 
OF NUMBERS. THEY WILL BE TOLD THAT THIER GUESSING NUMBER IS TOO
 HIGH, TOO LOW, OR CORRECT AND END. THE FINAL PART WILL ASK THE 
 USER IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO PLAY AGAIN. THAT TOO WILL RQUIRE DATA 
 VAILDTION.

PEER REVIEW: NAME -- REVIEW
